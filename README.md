docker is able to make mini computers in your system to run uncompatible items.

git clone https://github.com/mohsa012/sandbox.git is my code.

Git is weird there's a whole repository of the changes on the device, Github has it's own completely seperate repository from the device. Any other computers who pull the code down have their own repository as well. The repositories don't know anything about eachother unless you tell the repository. Clone saves the information of the origin (github) repository the device only knows about your repository on github.
The most important thing is: the only way changes get to other repositories is if they are pushed or pulled.
